var TextData = []byte(`Go was designed at Google in 2007 to improve programming productivity in an era of multicore, networked machines and large codebases.[21] The designers wanted to address criticism of other languages in use at Google, but keep their useful characteristics:[22]

Static typing and run-time efficiency (like C)
Readability and usability (like Python)[23]
High-performance networking and multiprocessing
Its designers were primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++.[24][25][26]

Go was publicly announced in November 2009,[27] and version 1.0 was released in March 2012.[28][29] Go is widely used in production at Google[30] and in many other organizations and open-source projects.

Branding and styling

Mascot of Go programming language is a Gopher shown above.
The Gopher mascot was introduced in 2009 for the open source launch of the language. The design, by Ren√©e French, borrowed from a c. 2000 WFMU promotion.[31]

In November 2016, the Go and Go Mono fonts were released by type designers Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes specifically for use by the Go project. Go is a humanist sans-serif resembling Lucida Grande, and Go Mono is monospaced. Both fonts adhere to the WGL4 character set and were designed to be legible with a large x-height and distinct letterforms. Both Go and Go Mono adhere to the DIN 1450 standard by having a slashed zero, lowercase l with a tail, and an uppercase I with serifs.[32][33]

In April 2018, the original logo was replaced with a stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. (The Gopher mascot remained the same.[34])

Generics
The lack of support for generic programming in initial versions of Go drew considerable criticism.[35] The designers expressed an openness to generic programming and noted that built-in functions were in fact type-generic, but are treated as special cases; Pike called this a weakness that might be changed at some point.[36] The Google team built at least one compiler for an experimental Go dialect with generics, but did not release it.[37]

In August 2018, the Go principal contributors published draft designs for generic programming and error handling and asked users to submit feedback.[38][39] However, the error handling proposal was eventually abandoned.[40]

In June 2020, a new draft design document[41] was published that would add the necessary syntax to Go for declaring generic functions and types. A code translation tool, go2go, was provided to allow users to try the new syntax, along with a generics-enabled version of the online Go Playground.[42]

Generics were finally added to Go in version 1.18.`)
